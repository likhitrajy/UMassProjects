Likhit Raj Yerramsetty's game of CLUE:
This game implements many themes and basics of C like usage of structs, pointers, string comparators, etc.
I am submitting the README file with main.c, rooms.c, rooms.h, characters.h, items.h, items.c.
The header files contain the parent structs, functions and other basic material which are used throughout the C
files.
The code is very user-friendly and you can start running the project after unzipping the rar file.
I used pointers in various aspects of the code. I also used arrays with a mixture of the concept of the
pointers. I used randomizers to shuffle up the game board, items and which rooms the characters are in each
game. 
I used inbuilt string comparators to check the user input to the answers and the commands. And very simple
boolean values to check whether a command is valid or correct.

Thank you.
